"In this tutorial, you will master the MERN Stack CRUD Operations by building a User app"

"Specifically, we will create a simple UserBook app that allows a user to add a phone number along with a name, update the User number name and email, view the UserDeatils list, and delete userDeatils.
We will use MongoDB to store our data, ExpressJS to handle the backend, and ReactJS to handle the front end."

"By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to create your own CRUD application using the MERN stack and have a complete understanding of a full-stack project."
